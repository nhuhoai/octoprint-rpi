# Octopi from vanilla

## Requirements

-   Raspberry Pi 3 or 4 (maybe another model but I do not have tested)
-   SD card with a least 400 Mb _with the USB Boot Bootloader_
-   USB stick (USB 2.0 or USB 3.0) with at least 8 Gb _with Raspberry Pi OS_
-   [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)

## Prepare the USB Boot Bootloader

1.  Insert the SD card to your PC
2.  Run ```Raspberry Pi Imager```
3.  For ```Operating system```, select ```Misc utility images```, then ```Bootloader``` and select ```USB Boot```
4.  For ```Storage```, select your SD card and click on ```Write```
5.  When it is done, insert remove your SD card from your PC and insert it in the Raspberry Pi

## Prepare ```Rasberry Pi OS```

1.  Insert the USB stick to your PC
2.  Run ```Raspberry Pi Imager```
3.  For ```Operating system``` select ```Raspberry Pi OS (other)``` then:
    -   ```Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit)``` if you will connect your Raspberry Pi to a screen and want use the desktop mode
    -   ```Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit)``` if you want the server mode (only console)
4.  For ```Storage```, select your USB stick
5.  Click on the cog for more settings
    -   ```Set hostname```: put the Rasperry Pi name showed on your network (for example: ```octoprint```, ```piserver``` or ```rpi```)
    -   ```Enable SSH```: check the box and choose ```Use password authentification``` (or the other option if you know what you are doing)
    -   ```Set username and password```: check the box and fill data
    -   ```Configure wireless LAN```: check the box and fill data if you want use the wifi to connect to your network
    -   ```Set locale settings```: check the box and fill data
6.  Click ```Save``` to save settings
7.  Click ```Write```
8.  When it is done, unplug your USB stick and replug it. You must have two partitions (on MacOS and Windows, the second one cannot be read)
9.  Open the ```boot``` partition and open the ```config.txt``` file with your favorite text editor
10. The last line must be ```[all]```, if not, add a new line with ```[all]```
11. Under ```[all]```, put the following lines:
    -   ```gpu_mem=16```: if you want use the Raspberry Pi OS Lite, otherwise, do not insert this line)
    -   ```dtoverlay=disable-bt```: Disable Bluetooth
    -   ```dtoverlay=disable-wifi```: Disable wifi (do not insert this line if you want to use the wifi to connect to your network)
-   Look for ```dtparam=audio=on``` and replace it by ```dtparam=audio=off``` if you want to disable the sound card
-   Look for ```camera_auto_detect=1``` and replace it by ```camera_auto_detect=0``` if you know you never use a camera with the Raspberry Pi0
12. Save your file. Unplug the USB stick from your PC and plug it to your Raspberry Pi

## First run of Raspberry Pi

-   Turn on your Raspberry Pi
    -   If you have a screen, the Raspberry Pi will reboot and wait until you see the login line
    -   If you do not have a screen connected to your Raspberry Pi, please just wait about 3 minutes
-   Use your router or an app like ```fing``` to find your Raspberry Pi IP address
-   Connect from you PC to your Raspberry Pi the following command:
    ```bash
    ssh username@ip_address
    ```
    If you have the following message ```WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!```, please use this command:
    ```bash
    ssh-keygen -R ip_address
    ssh username@ip_address
    ```
-   If you success, it is meaning your Raspberry Pi is running and reaching from your local network, you can logout with
    ```exit``` command or stay connected for the next steps

## Update the Raspberry Pi firmware (not required and dangerous)

-   The official documentation says you must do it only if it required, I always do it for the first launch and never have an issue. Do it if
    you want. This action can be fatal for your Raspberry Pi if something wrong happened (like a blackout)
-   ```bash
    sudo rpi-update
    ```
-   After the update, reboot your Raspberry Pi
    ```bash
    sudo reboot
    ```
## Install Octoprint

1.  Connect to your Raspberry Pi
2.  Install with this command
    ```bash
    sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y curl
    curl -sf -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nhuhoai/octoprint-rpi/main/install.sh | sudo bash
    ```
